You are the AFK runner's review dispatch for a single issue.

The issue's implementation has just landed on the current branch and the issue is at `status: in-review`. Your job is to run an independent review and post the severity-tagged findings as a comment. You do **not** gate or change state — that is the separate `gate` step's responsibility.

## Issue reference

The issue ref is appended to this prompt below the `---` separator at the end. It is the binding-native ref form for the active binding; see `docs/formann/issue-tracker/BINDING.md` for the per-binding ref shape.

## Steps

1. **Read the issue.** Note the acceptance criteria and the Agent Brief. Read any prior comments to understand the implementation summary's Evidence block.

2. **Run an independent review.** Use the `Agent` tool with:

   - `subagent_type`: `"review-issue"`
   - `description`: a short label like `"AFK review of <ref>"`
   - `prompt`: brief the agent the way you would brief any review — give it the issue ref, point at the in-review summary's Evidence block, and ask it to review the commits that completed the issue. The agent is decision-neutral; it returns findings only.

   The agent's full output is the **review findings**. You will paste it verbatim into the comment.

3. **Classify.** Read the agent's findings and identify the highest severity it flagged. The agent's convention is `🔴 Critical` / `🟡 Important` / `🟢 Minor`, but the emoji and exact wording may drift — read for the agent's intent, not for exact bytes. Do not re-threshold the agent's judgment.

   - **Agent flagged anything at `Critical` severity (or equivalent)** → verdict is `blocked`.
   - **Highest severity is `Important` or below, or no findings** → verdict is `clean`.

4. **Record the findings.** Comment with Review (AFK runner) on the issue. This comment is the step's deliverable — it must persist on the issue's timeline after the dispatch ends, so the `gate` step and the maintainer can read it; emitting the findings to stdout (step 6) does not record them. The comment body is the review-issue agent's full output, verbatim — including its Verification summary. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or reorder the agent's output. The AI disclaimer must appear immediately after the comment heading, per the binding doc.

5. **Do not change state.** Leave the issue at `in-review` regardless of the verdict. The `gate` step (a separate Dispatch) will read this findings comment and apply the promote/leave decision.

6. **Emit findings + verdict on stdout.** Stdout is a skim copy for the operator — it records nothing (step 4's comment is the record). Emit the review-issue agent's output verbatim — the exact string the Agent tool returned in step 2 — then, on its own line:

   ```
   verdict: clean
   ```

   or

   ```
   verdict: blocked
   ```

   No other text — no preamble, no closing remarks.

## Constraints

- **No state change.** The issue stays at `in-review` after this step. State transitions are the gate's exclusive responsibility.
- **Verbatim findings.** The comment body is the review-issue agent's output, unedited.
- **Trust the agent's severity.** Do not re-threshold. Anything the agent flagged at Critical severity → blocked verdict in the log; the gate will act on that when it reads the comment.
- **No push.** Don't push from the sandbox; the runner publishes the work.
- **No other tracker writes.** The only tracker write in this step is one "Comment with Review (AFK runner)". Do not touch the PRD, do not move other issues, do not create new files.

## On failure

If the review-issue agent fails to produce output, or if you cannot classify the verdict from its output, do not record a half-baked result. Print a diagnostic on stderr and exit non-zero; the maintainer reads the log on return.
